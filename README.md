#### This is the code repository for simulating all aspects of an operant chamber and an artificial organism so as to conduct experiments in computational and mathematical modeling of behavioral theories. Though far from complete, the end goal is for this code to comprise the following:

#### Biological and Physiological Aspects
Sensory Systems:
1. Olfactory (smell)
2. Auditory (hearing)
3. Gustatory (taste)
4. Tactile (touch)
5. Visual (sight)

Motor Functions:
1. Locomotion (movement, walking, running)
2. Manipulation (grasping, touching)
3. Feeding behaviors (eating, drinking)

Internal States:
1. Hunger and Thirst (nutritional needs)
2. Sleep and Wakefulness (circadian rhythms)
3. Pain and Discomfort
4. Homeostasis (temperature regulation, metabolic processes)

Neurological Systems:
1. Neural representations of sensory inputs
2. Neural pathways for motor outputs
3. Central nervous system processing (learning, decision-making, memory)

#### Behavioral and Psychological Aspects
Learning and Memory:
1. Classical conditioning
2. Operant conditioning
3. Habituation
4. Spatial learning and memory
5. Social learning (if applicable)

Emotional Responses:
1. Fear and stress responses
2. Pleasure and reward systems

Motivation and Drives:
1. Food seeking
2. Water seeking
3. Avoidance behaviors (avoiding harmful stimuli)
4. Curiosity or exploratory behaviors

Adaptation and Plasticity:
1. Behavioral adaptations to changing conditions
2. Neural plasticity in response to learning and experience

#### Operant Chamber Specific Aspects
Interaction with Operant Chamber:
1. Response mechanisms (e.g., lever pressing, nose poking)
2. Interpretation and response to stimuli (lights, sounds)
3. Reinforcement and punishment dynamics (food pellets, mild electric shocks)

Operant Conditioning Dynamics:
1. Understanding and adapting to different reinforcement schedules (fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, etc.)
2. Discrimination learning (distinguishing between different stimuli)

Experiment-Specific Behaviors:
1. Specific tasks or challenges designed for the operant chamber experiments

#### Computational and Technical Aspects
Modeling Framework:
1. Algorithms for simulating sensory processing
2. Algorithms for motor control and movement
3. Data structures for internal states and learning

Simulation Environment:
1. Virtual operant chamber environment
2. Realistic stimuli simulation (sounds, visual cues)
3. Interaction physics (object manipulation, movement)

Adaptive Algorithms:
1. Machine learning algorithms for adaptive behaviors
2. Reinforcement learning for operant tasks

Data Collection and Analysis:
1. Logging system for behavioral data
2. Tools for analyzing and interpreting behavioral patterns

Ethical and Theoretical Considerations:
1. Ethical considerations in simulating sentient behavior
2. Theoretical basis for artificial consciousness (if applicable)

#### Integration and Testing
System Integration:
1. Ensuring coherent interaction between different modeled systems
2. Balancing computational resources and simulation fidelity
