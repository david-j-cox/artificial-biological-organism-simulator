# artificial-biological-organism-simulator

## This is the code repository for simulating all aspects of an operant chamber and an artificial organism so as to conduct experiments in computational and mathematical modeling of behavioral theories. Though far from complete, the end goal is for this code to comprise the following:

## Biological and Physiological Aspects
### Sensory Systems:
1. Olfactory (smell)
2. Auditory (hearing)
3. Gustatory (taste)
4. Tactile (touch)
5. Visual (sight)

### Motor Functions:
1. Locomotion (movement, walking, running)
2. Manipulation (grasping, touching)
3. Feeding behaviors (eating, drinking)

### Internal States:
1. Hunger and Thirst (nutritional needs)
2. Sleep and Wakefulness (circadian rhythms)
3. Pain and Discomfort
4. Homeostasis (temperature regulation, metabolic processes)

### Neurological Systems:
1. Neural representations of sensory inputs
2. Neural pathways for motor outputs
3. Central nervous system processing (learning, decision-making, memory)
